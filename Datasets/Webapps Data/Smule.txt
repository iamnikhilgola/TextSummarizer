9. SMULE CONTENT AND RIGHTS GRANTED TO YOU
License. Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Smule grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free, and worldwide right and license to use the Service. Pursuant to this license, you may: (i) download, access, and use an object code version of the Apps on any device that you own or control; and (ii) access and use the Service, solely for your personal, non-commercial use.
Smule Content. Except for User Content (as defined in Section 10.a below), the content that Smule provides to Users on or through the Service, including, without limitation, any sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), video, text, graphics, photos, software, and interactive features, is protected by copyright or other intellectual property rights and owned by Smule or its third-party licensors (collectively, "Smule Content"). Smule Content is exclusively for use as part of the Smule Service and may not be exported outside of the Smule Service, except as explicitly permitted and endorsed by Smule. Any attempt to circumvent this provision is a violation of these Terms. Smule also solely owns all design rights, databases and compilations, and other intellectual property rights in and to the Service, in each case whether registered or unregistered, and any related goodwill.
Smule Marks. The Smule trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the "Smule Trademarks") used and displayed on the Service are Smule’s registered and/or unregistered trademarks or service marks. Any other product and service names located on any part of the Service may be trademarks or service marks owned by third parties (collectively with the Smule Trademarks, the "Trademarks"). Except as otherwise permitted by law, you may not use the Trademarks to disparage Smule or the applicable third party, or in any manner that may damage any goodwill in the Trademarks. You may not use any Trademarks as part of a link to or from any website without Smule’s prior express written consent. All goodwill generated from the use of any Smule Trademark will inure solely to Smule’s benefit.
Reservation of Rights. Smule hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this Section 9. Nothing in these Terms or on the Service will be construed as granting to you additional license rights in and to the Service or any Smule Content or Trademarks.
10. USER CONTENT AND RIGHTS YOU GRANT TO SMULE
"User Content" means any content that you or other Users upload, post, or transmit to or through the Service (collectively, "Post") including, without limitation, photographs, text, sound recordings, musical works, or audiovisual works, and any other works subject to protection under the laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction, including, without limitation, patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws. For clarity, User Content excludes any and all Smule Content. You may Post User Content and otherwise use and enjoy its various functionalities, subject to these Terms.
Ownership. SUBJECT TO ANY THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS IN ANY PREEXISTING CONTENT THAT IS A PART OF YOUR USER CONTENT AND SUBJECT TO THE LICENSE YOU GRANT TO SMULE, YOU RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR USER CONTENT, AND POSTING YOUR USER CONTENT DOES NOT TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF YOUR RIGHTS.
License to Smule. You hereby grant Smule an unrestricted, assignable, sublicensable, royalty-free worldwide license to exploit and use ("Use") the User Content you Post by any means, for the purposes of: (i) advertising, marketing, and promoting Smule and the Service; (ii) displaying and sharing your User Content; and (iii) providing the Service as authorized by these Terms. You further grant Smule a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as the source of your User Content. Any User Content Posted by you or otherwise transmitted to Smule will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary, and treated as such by Smule, and may be used by Smule in accordance with these Terms without notice to you and without any liability to Smule. To the greatest extent permitted by law and subject to our Privacy Policy, the license granted in this Section is irrevocable. Your license to Smule grants us the right to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, make available, create derivative works from, and otherwise Use any or all of your User Content. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in this Section include, but are not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound recordings) and publicly perform and communicate sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein) to the public, all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting Smule the right to Use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party. In consideration of the provision of the Service to you, you hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive any moral rights in or to your User Content and all rights to object to derogatory treatment of the User Content which you may now or at any time in the future be entitled under European Union ("EU") law, the law of the constituent member states of the EU, and all rights of the same or similar effect or nature in any part of the world in favor of Smule, its assignees, licensees, designees and successors-in-title.
Enforcement Rights. As part of your license to Smule, you give Smule the right to enforce any copyrights you possess in your User Content against any third parties who copy, reproduce, distribute, publicly display, communicate to the public, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), make available, create derivative works from, retransmit from External Sites, or otherwise exploit and use, the User Content without Smule’s consent, including by using the Service or otherwise downloading your User Content off of the App or website.
You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post. By Posting User Content, you represent and warrant that you own or are fully authorized to grant the license set forth in these Terms in all elements of the User Content. For example, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not Post such sound recordings unless you have all necessary rights, authorizations, and permissions with respect to such embedded musical works that grant you sufficient rights to grant the license to Smule under these Terms. You further represent and warrant that: (i) the Posting and Use of your User Content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights, or any other rights of any party; (ii) the Posting of your User Content will not require Smule to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts, or provide any attribution to any third parties; and (iii) the Posting of your User Content does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay all monies owing to any person as a result of User Content you Post.
Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a performing rights organization ("PRO"), then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant to Smule through these Terms. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license set forth in these Terms or have such music publisher enter into this Agreement with Smule. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant Smule the license in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the Service that may be claimed by your label.
Through-To-The-Audience Rights. All of the rights you grant in this Agreement are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of External Sites will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User Content Posted or Used on such External Sites via the Service.
Waiver of Rights to User Content. By Posting User Content, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any similar rights in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain, or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in any User Content you Post.
Objectionable Content. You agree not to Post any User Content that could be interpreted in Smule’s sole discretion to be (i) abusive, bullying, defamatory, harassing, harmful, hateful, inaccurate, infringing, libelous, objectionable, obscene, offensive, pornographic, shocking, threatening, unlawful, violent, or vulgar, (ii) in violation of any applicable laws, (iii) putting other Users’ data privacy and security at risk; (iv) promoting any product, good or service; (v) promoting bigotry, discrimination, hatred, intolerance, or racism; or (vi) inciting violence (collectively, "Objectionable Content"). The Posting of any Objectionable Content may subject you to third-party claims and none of the rights granted to you in these Terms may be raised as a defense against any third-party claims arising from your Posting of Objectionable Content. Smule in its sole discretion may take any actions it deems necessary and/or appropriate against any User who Posts Objectionable Content, including, without limitation, warning the User, suspending or terminating the User’s Account, removing all of the User’s User Content, and/or reporting the User to law enforcement authorities, either directly or indirectly.
Screening Content. Smule does not pre-screen any User Content, but reserves the right to remove or delete any User Content in its sole discretion. In addition, Smule has the right—but not the obligation—in its sole discretion to remove or delete any User Content: (i) that Smule considers to violate these Terms or applicable law; (ii) that Smule considers to be Objectionable Content; or (iii) in response to complaints from other Users, licensors of any Smule Content, or rights holders related to the User Content, with or without notice and without any liability from Smule to you. Smule also has the right—but not the obligation—to take remedial action in connection with any Objectionable Content Posted as described more fully in the Community Guidelines. Smule recommends that you save copies of any User Content that you Post on your personal device(s) to the extent you want to ensure permanent access to copies of such User Content.
User Content Posted by Others. Although Smule reserves the right to review or remove any User Content, we do not review all User Content, and we take no responsibility for the User Content that appears on the Service. User Content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that Posts the User Content. As reflected in these Terms and in our Community Guidelines, we have no tolerance for Objectionable Content, and we do not want our Service put to any improper use, but we cannot guarantee that all User Content will always conform to these Terms. If you encounter any Objectionable Content on the Service, please immediately email Smule at community@smule.com. Smule provides you with the ability to report Objectionable Content as a courtesy, and Smule has no obligation to remove or take any other action with respect to any Objectionable Content on the Service that you report to Smule.
No Liability. For the avoidance of doubt, Smule will not be liable for any use or misuse of User Content by any User.
Feedback. If you choose to provide Smule with input or suggestions regarding problems with or proposed modifications, enhancements or improvements to the Service ("Feedback"), including but not limited to any Feedback you provide if Smule invites you to participate in new product functionality testing, then you hereby grant to Smule a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, and royalty-free right to use and exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose without any restriction, credit, attribution, or fees due to you
11. EXTERNAL SITES

Smule is also not responsible for the content of any External Sites and does not make any representations regarding the content on such External Sites.

The External Sites may have their own terms of service and privacy policies, and your use of those External Sites will be governed by and subject to such terms of service and privacy policies. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any questions or concerns regarding any content located on such External Sites or the terms governing your use of such External Sites.

If you decide to access any External Sites, purchase any content from External Sites, or subscribe to services offered by such External Sites, then you do so at your own risk. You agree that Smule will have no liability to you arising from your use or interaction with any External Sites.

14. VIRTUAL CURRENCY
The following terms apply to the extent permitted under law:

Currency. You may be able to earn virtual currency for certain achievements attained within the Service ("Currency"). Smule determines and controls the availability and nature of Currency in its sole discretion. Accordingly, you agree that Smule may terminate, modify, revalue, or make Currency more or less available without any notice or liability to you. You may not rely on continued availability of any Currency. Smule also determines the amount of your Currency balance in its sole discretion.
Ownership. Smule provides Currency to you under a limited, personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and worldwide license to redeem such Currency solely to purchase digital goods available within the Service ("Goods"). Accordingly, except as set forth in the prior sentence, Smule owns and retains all rights, title, and interest in and to Currency.
Redemption. The amount of Currency needed to obtain Goods will be displayed at the point of redemption. Currency is not real money and does not have any monetary value. Currency may only be redeemed to obtain Goods and cannot be combined or used in conjunction with other promotions, coupons, discounts, or special offers from Smule unless Smule expressly states otherwise in writing. Upon redemption of any Currency, the amount available in your Account will be reduced by the amount redeemed.
Replacements. Smule may redistribute previously obtained copies of Goods, if, in its sole determination, the purchaser received corrupted or otherwise damaged Goods. If Goods you have purchased or received are corrupted or otherwise damaged, then please send an email explaining the problem and the circumstances under which such problem arose to community@smule.com. Smule has the sole discretion to terminate the Account of any User that Smule suspects to be abusing the right to seek replacement Goods. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences of this Section, Smule is not responsible for replacing any of your Goods or providing you with any credit for any Goods.
No Transfers. Currency and Goods may not be sold, assigned, or transferred to any third party under any circumstances whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law) unless Smule expressly preapproves the transfer in writing, and any sale, assignment, or transfer of Currency or Goods to any third party without such consent will be void. If a User violates this Section, then Smule may, in its sole discretion: (i) terminate the offending User’s Account; (ii) require the offending User to forfeit all Goods purchased and/or Currency obtained; and/or (iii) pursue any and all remedies that Smule deems advisable and hold the offending User liable for any and all damages, expenses, or other losses that Smule incurs in connection with the violation.
Forfeiture. If your Account is terminated for any reason, then you automatically will forfeit all Currency and Goods associated with that Account permanently. Smule also reserves the right to terminate your Account and all associated Currency and Goods if your Account has been inactive for 180 days.
15. NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTS
Respect of Third-Party Rights. Smule respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously. We ask you to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.
Repeat Infringer Policy.

Smule considers a "repeat infringer" to be any User that has Posted User Content and for whom Smule has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content. Smule has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Smule’s own determination.
Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any content made available on or through the Service has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" containing substantially the following information to Smule’s Designated Agent identified below:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;
Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works;
Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Smule to locate the material;

A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.

We may share the Notification of Claimed Infringement with the User alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to Smule making such disclosure.

Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from Smule that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Smule with what is called a "Counter Notification."

A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.

Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.

19. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement is governed by the substantive laws of the State of California without regard to its laws that would direct the choice of any other state’s laws.

If you are a consumer who lives in the EU, this Section 19 is without prejudice to any rights you may have under mandatory law which cannot be varied by contractual choice of law.

20. ARBITRATION
This Section 20 does not apply if you reside in the European Economic Area or in another jurisdiction which prohibits mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer contracts.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Smule in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Smule agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SMULE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.
Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 20.a above, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Smule will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Smule. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail ("Notice"). Smule's address for Notice is: Smule, Inc., ATTN: General Counsel, 139 Townsend Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94107. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Smule may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Smule must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award, Smule will pay you the highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; or (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Smule in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.
Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Smule will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance-based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Smule for all monies previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
Waiver of Class Actions. YOU AND SMULE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Smule agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SMULE AGREE TO WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JURY. You and Smule are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Smule over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SMULE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL.
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, if Smule makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Smule’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending Smule written notice within 30 days of the change to Smule’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Smule.
Opt-out. You may opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Smule can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Smule in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Smule username and the email address you used to set up your Smule account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: Smule, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 139 Townsend Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94107, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@smule.com.
Enforceability. If Section 20.f above is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 20 will be null and void. If this Arbitration Provision is invalidated in whole or in part, Section 21 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Service.
21. VENUE
To the extent a claim, dispute, or controversy arises out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Service that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 20, both you and Smule agree that all such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. If that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. You and Smule consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.

22. TIME FOR FILING
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM AGAINST SMULE MUST BE COMMENCED BY FILING A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION UNDER SECTION 20 (OR BY FILING AN ACTION UNDER SECTION 21 TO THE EXTENT SECTION 20 DOES NOT APPLY) WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE ACT, OMISSION, OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. YOU AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.

23. INDEMNITY
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Smule harmless from and against any claims, actions or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from: (a) your breach of this Agreement; (b) your access to, use, or misuse of Smule Content or the Service; or (c) your User Content.

Smule will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Smule reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is subject to indemnification under this Section if Smule believes that you are unwilling or incapable of defending Smule’s interests. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Smule’s defense of such matter at your expense.

24. ADDITIONAL TERMS
From time to time, Smule may require you to agree to additional terms and/or policies that it makes available to you in connection with your use of the Service or in connection with a special promotion ("Additional Terms"). Except as expressly stated otherwise, such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated into and subject to this Agreement. This Agreement will control in the event of any conflict or inconsistency with the Additional Terms to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.

25. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect.

26. LOCAL LAWS

Smule makes no representation that materials on the Service are appropriate, lawful, or available for use in any locations other than the United States of America.
