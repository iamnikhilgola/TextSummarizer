ADDITIONAL CRYPTO WALLET TERMS

Opera’s crypto wallet Service provides self-hosted, user controlled services related to Ethereum and related cryptographically secured tokens (“Crypto Currency”). While commonly referred to as a “wallet”, it is important for you to understand that, unlike cash in a physical wallet, Crypto Currency is not stored in the wallet.

Our wallet Service stores a key pair (an address or public key, as well as an encrypted private key). The key pair enables you to communicate with Ethereum-based blockchains (“Ethereum Networks”) through our wallet Service and without requiring you to download or install additional software to your device. Any Crypto Currency, however, is stored, sent and received by and within the relevant Ethereum Network. The wallet Service facilitates your communications with and use of these Ethereum Networks.

Ethereum Networks are peer-to-peer networks supported by third parties. In order to be completed, all proposed transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Crypto Currency’s associated network. We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit will be confirmed and processed, or that this will occur in a timely manner. You should carefully asses the Ethereum Network and Crypto Currency with which you choose to transact. Use of our wallet Service is subject to these Terms of Service, including the following:

a. Create or Import a Wallet. To use this Service, you must either import an existing wallet or create a new wallet. If you create a new wallet, you will be assigned a key pair consisting of a public key (or address) for your wallet, as well as an encrypted private key. You will also be assigned a human readable, mnemonic pass phrase (“Backup Phrase”) for use in accessing your encrypted private key.

b. Write Down Your Backup Phrase. When creating a new wallet, you will be prompted to write down your Backup Phrase. Your wallet does not receive or store your Backup Phrase. Neither your key pair nor the Backup Phrase is available to us. We cannot, therefore, assist you with key pair or Backup Phrase retrieval. We cannot generate a new Backup Phrase for your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that any Crypto Currency you have associated with your wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Backup Phrase. We also strongly encourage users to take a backup of their Backup Phrase as well as their key pair on an external medium.

c. Keep Your Backup Phrase Secure. The Backup Phrase can be used to unlock your encrypted private key, which is stored in a separate file on your device. The private key is connected to your wallet’s public address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Crypto Currency to and from that address. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Backup Phrase, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur using such Backup Phrase.

d. You are Responsible to Manage Your Crypto Currency. Once transaction details have been submitted to an Ethereum Network it is not possible to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. We have no control over any Ethereum Network and we do not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification request. You must ensure that you have adequate Crypto Currency associated with your wallet address before initiating a transaction.

e. You Must Comply With the Law. You can only use our wallet Service if permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that your use of the wallet Service are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to your Crypto Currency transactions, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority where applicable. We are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any of your transactions.
