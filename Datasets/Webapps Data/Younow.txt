1. WELCOME

Welcome to the Service. It was created by YouNow as a platform for personal communication and entertainment.

As You probably know by now, the Service is a live-video social entertainment platform. Subject to the Terms of Use (as they might be amended) and any other applicable agreements between You and YouNow, the Service allows You to broadcast Your video (via web or mobile device) for viewing - IN REAL TIME - by a public online audience including followers and fans and to view the video broadcasts of other users of the Service. The Service offers other functions as well that are described in the Terms of Use and in notices and publications from YouNow. YouNow reserves the right in its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete features and functions of the Service at any time.

We take responsibility for what we have created, and You agree to take responsibility for Your use of our Service whether as a creator of Content (defined below) or as a viewer. While You have fun using the Service, we require that You treat others with respect, do not use the Service for anything that would be deemed illegal or obscene and always observe the Golden Rule ("do unto others..."). See our Frequently Asked Questions page for further information about use of the Service.
2. REGISTRATION

In order to access some features of the Service, and to be able to Submit (as that term is defined below) Content as a broadcaster, You will have to create a YouNow account via Your Facebook®, Google+®, Twitter®, or Instagram® account, using the same information provided to one of those networks (the “YouNow Account”). You can alter such information by updating Your Facebook®, Google+®, Twitter®, or Instagram® account (this will automatically update Your YouNow Account the next time You log in). You also may alter Your YouNow Account information by logging into the Service and accessing Your settings.

You agree not to share Your YouNow Account password or let others have access to Your Account and You will not attempt to transfer Your YouNow Account to anyone else. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through Your account, so we urge You to keep Your account password secure and to always log-off when leaving Your computer or mobile device unattended. Although YouNow will not be liable for losses caused by any unauthorized use of Your YouNow Account, You may be liable for the losses of YouNow or others due to unauthorized use. We strongly recommend that You notify us immediately of unauthorized use of Your YouNow Account or of any related security breach by contacting us at support@younow.com. If for any reason You want to limit Your children's access to the Service, there are a number of commercially available parental control protections.
3. OWNERSHIP OF THE SERVICE

All elements of the Service, including underlying platforms, software, look and feel, and other components (“Service Components”), to the full extent protectable by law, are either proprietary to YouNow or proprietary to our licensors. "YouNow®" and other trademarks, slogans, service marks, and trade names (collectively, “Trademarks”), which are used to identify the Service and/or the source of the Service, are proprietary to YouNow. You shall not remove or alter any copyright notice, Trademark or other proprietary or restrictive notice or legend affixed to any material provided as part of the Service or otherwise provided by YouNow. Except as expressly set forth in the Terms of Use, no license, assignment, or other grant of rights in any Service Components, Trademarks, copyrights, or any other intellectual property is granted to You and no such grant will result from Your accessing or using the Service. All rights in the Service not granted under the Terms of Use are reserved by YouNow.

The Service may contain links to third party services that are not owned or controlled by YouNow. YouNow has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party services. In addition, YouNow will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third party service. You expressly release YouNow from any and all liability both known and unknown arising from Your use of any third party service.
4. USER GENERATED CONTENT

The term “Content” refers to any information, data, communication, video, text, graphics, photos (including but not limited to “Selfies” and “Moments”), sounds, music, audiovisual works, chat feed comments, gifting and/or other contributions appearing on the Service that users of the Service may broadcast, upload, or otherwise submit (collectively, “Submit”) to the Service, or view or access on the Service.

All right, title and interest in Content Submitted by You to the Service, to the extent it does not belong to third parties or Guests (see Section 5), will remain with You, subject to the licenses You make hereunder. YouNow does not and will not claim any ownership over such Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You hereby waive any moral rights that You may have in Your Content in favor of YouNow and anyone acting with the authorization of YouNow.

YouNow assumes no responsibility for Content Submitted by You or any other users of the Service. You shall be solely liable for Content that You Submit to the Service, including without limitation for any consequences of publishing the Content through the Service. Your potential liability applies, for example, to any Content that You include in a broadcast initiated by You, even if you are not the creator of that Content.

You hereby affirm, represent and warrant that You will own or obtain all necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to enable YouNow to publish and otherwise utilize as authorized in the Terms of Use, the Content You Submit to the Service.

You understand that the Service is intended for public use and not for private communications, and You confirm that You have a limited expectation of privacy with regard to any Content You may Submit to the Service, or any other communication by You made to or through the Service. Furthermore, You are aware that YouNow does not guarantee the security of any information You disclose via the Service and any submission of Content by You to the Service is made at Your own risk.

All of the provisions in this Section 4 shall apply with equal force if You Submit Content that includes advertorials, native advertising, or sponsorship (“Sponsored Content”). Without limitation, all of Your representations, warranties, indemnification obligations, and other obligations under the Terms of Use will apply equally to Sponsored Content as they would to any other Content You Submit. You are solely responsible for ensuring that Your Sponsored Content complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission’s Guides Concerning Endorsements and Testimonials (“FTC Guidelines”), including all required disclosures and disclaimers.

As with other Content, YouNow assumes no liability for Sponsored Content Submitted by You or any other users of the Service, or for any product or service offered by or through Sponsored Content (“Sponsored Products and Services”). You shall be solely liable for Sponsored Content that You Submit to the Service and all elements of it, including without limitation for Sponsored Products and Services and for any other consequences of transmission of Sponsored Content through the Service.

In addition to all other termination provisions set forth in the Terms of Use, YouNow reserves the right to terminate immediately Your access to the Service if You fail to make disclosures in any Sponsored Content You Submit in accordance with the FTC Guidelines or as otherwise required by applicable law. Further, in the event that Sponsored Content Submitted by You includes material or promotes products or services which, in YouNow’s sole opinion, might insult or offend users of the Service or which might tend to injure the success of the Service or the good name of YouNow, or if Your Sponsored Content does not comply with the Acceptable Use Policy set forth in Section 6 below, or, as determined in YouNow’s sole opinion, conflicts with or does not align with YouNow’s business, community, ethical or other goals, then YouNow shall have the right (a) to require that You cease submission of the Sponsored Content and/or (b) immediately terminate Your access to the Service.

By Submitting Content to the Service, You are granting YouNow and its agents and designees a perpetual worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform such Content in connection with the Service and with the businesses of YouNow and those of its successors, licensees, and affiliates, including without limitation for the purpose of promoting and advertising the Service and redistributing part or all of the Service (and works derived therefrom) in any and all media formats and through any and all media channels now known or later developed.

Without limitation, the foregoing license includes the right of YouNow to grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access Your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service, subject to the Terms of Use. Such functionality currently includes the ability of users to capture segments from broadcasts of Content and to make such segments available on users’ own YouNow Account at the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such segments via any and all channels of social media. (YouNow shall have the right but not the obligation to remove such segments from users’ account pages at the Service.)
Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to permit use of such Content by users of the Service for endorsements of any product or service (other than the Service), or for any other commercial purpose, not authorized by You.

In connection with the exercise of each of the foregoing rights licensed by You, You consent to use of Your name, image, likeness, photograph, performance, voice, biographical details, Facebook ID, Twitter handle, Google+ ID, Instagram ID, profile pictures, and any other attributes of Your persona in any and all media now known or hereafter developed, including but not limited to the Internet (such as on the Site and on third party social media websites) and mobile applications, worldwide, in perpetuity; all without payment, compensation or further notification to or permission from You, except where prohibited by law.

You hereby release and discharge all claims both known and unknown against, and covenant not to sue, YouNow and Related Parties (defined below) with respect to the use of any Content Submitted by You as authorized by the Terms of Use (including without limitation any claims that such use violates any proprietary right such as copyrights or rights of publicity/privacy).
5. GUEST BROADCASTS

While using the Service, You may either initiate (as a broadcaster) or participate as a Guest (defined below) in a broadcast through a Guest Broadcast or by Submitting Selfies, by gifting, Submitting chat, or by using another feature of the Service that introduces Content onto the screen (“Guest Broadacsting”). For purposes of the Terms of Use, the initiating broadcaster shall be deemed the “Host” of the Guest Broadcast (and shall control the Guest Broadcast) and a user contributing to the Guest Broadcast shall be deemed a “Guest.” For clarity, only users of the Service who have agreed to be bound by the Terms of Use shall be eligible to participate as Guests in Guest Broadcasts.

Any content Submitted by a Guest to a Guest Broadcast shall be considered Content for all purposes of the Terms of Use. Without limitation, in connection with such Content and otherwise, the Guest shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use, including without limitation the Acceptable Use Policy in Section 6 below and the provisions of Section 13, provided that the Guest shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the applicable Host to the same extent provided in Section 13 with respect to YouNow and Related Parties (as defined below) from and against any and all Damages (defined below) arising out of any Content Submitted by a Guest in connection with a Guest Broadcast.

For clarity, all right, title and interest in Content Submitted by a Guest to a Guest Broadcast, to the extent it does not belong to third parties, will remain with the Guest, subject to the following: In addition to all licenses relating to Content provided above to YouNow and others, each Guest hereby grants to the Host, and each Host hereby grants to each Guest,, a perpetual worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such Guest Broadcast, including Content Submitted by the Guest or the Host. This would include, by way of example, posting on the Host’s or Guest’s (as applicable) YouNow account page or to social media, to the extent the functionality of the Service permits.

Each Guest and each Host hereby releases and discharges all claims both known and unknown against, and covenants not to sue (a) YouNow and Related Parties; and (b) the Host (if a Guest) and each Guest (if a Host); with respect to any use of any Guest Broadcast as authorized by the Terms of Use (including without limitation any claims that any such use violates any proprietary right of the Host or Guest as applicable, such as copyrights or rights of publicity/privacy).
6. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY

You expressly agree that all Content, including without limitation Sponsored Content, that You Submit will not be: (1) defamatory, libelous, abusive, or obscene, and without limitation, shall not include material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, federal, or international law; (2) infringe on the copyright or any other proprietary right of any person or entity; (3) invade the privacy of any person; (4) contain a virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, or any other harmful program or component; or (5) be otherwise inappropriate or unlawful.

You also agree that You will not (i) use the Service to spam others or create mass-emails, (ii) continue harmful behavior if You have been warned of such; (iii) use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouNow servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser, and/or (iv) create a false identity (except for a user name unique to you that does not violate the rights of a third party, such as a celebrity or owner of intellectual property); and/or (v) forge an email address or header; or in any other way attempt to mislead others as to the identity of the sender or the origin of the message. You agree not to copy, scrape, re-post, take screen shots of, save, share, distribute, modify or make derivative works of any Content provided through the Service, except as expressly provided through the Service’s functionality and in the Terms of Use.

You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes.
7. VIRTUAL CURRENCY/IN-SERVICE PURCHASES

At times, the Service will permit You to "buy" or "purchase" for use in the Service: (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual bars; or (b) virtual in-Service items, including but not limited to fan mail and engagement rings/proposals, 50 thumbs up, tipping (together with virtual currency, "Virtual Items"). These real world terms, however, are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, YouNow grants You a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that include the use of these Virtual Items.

A purchase of Virtual Items is complete only when you receive confirmation through the Service that You have redeemed iTunes or Google Play Store Wallet credits, or other third party currency accepted by the Service. Any virtual currency balance shown in Your YouNow Account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license to use the Virtual Items within the Service. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual or real currency credited back to Your YouNow Account, nor will You be able to receive a refund of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), including if Your access to the Service has been suspended, limited or terminated.

Your gift of certain Virtual Items to a broadcaster on the Service may, but will not necessarily, appear on screen or in the chat feed of the Content You are viewing. Purchase of the "Chat Now" privilege during high-traffic broadcasts will give You the opportunity to rejoin a chat feed that has become over-full and to remain in the chat feed for the remainder of the broadcast. Purchasers of "Chat Now" will receive priority over users who are participating in the chat feed for free.

Tips and other Virtual Items gifted to broadcasters may result in some revenue to them as determined in YouNow's sole discretion; however, YouNow makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the bars or Virtual Items You may give a broadcaster will correlate to the revenue such broadcaster may receive from YouNow.

Only users of the Service who initiate a broadcast will be eligible for Tips and other Virtual items. For example, Guests participating in a Guest Broadcast will not be eligible to receive Tips and other Virtual Items during that broadcast.
8. SUBSCRIPTIONS

YouNow may offer access to certain parts of the Service on a subscription basis (“Subscriptions”). Subscriptions shall be for a specified term selected by You through the Service. Subscription-based parts of the Service may renew automatically on a monthly or annual basis, with payment due prior to each renewal unless You cancel Your Subscription before the monthly Renewal Date that is disclosed to You when You activate Your Subscription, and through the Settings portion of the Service (in which case You may be responsible for making payments through the end of that calendar month). We may or may not notify You of upcoming Renewal Dates.

You agree to pay Your Subscription fee in advance of receiving any Subscription-based part of the Service. YouNow reserves the right to discontinue or modify any Subscription fee payment option. You are responsible for all charges incurred under Your YouNow Account and You are responsible for timely cancelation of Your Subscription regardless of whether You receive any notice from us. YouNow reserves the right to deactivate Subscription-based parts of the Service to Your YouNow Account if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount.

If You choose a Subscription-based service, You hereby grant YouNow permission to automatically charge the Subscription fee to Your chosen payment method at the beginning of each applicable payment period. Your access to Subscription-based services will not be established until YouNow has verified that the credit card or other payment information You provide for payment is accurate and that Your payment method account is in good standing.

You are required to keep Your billing information current, complete and accurate (for example, if You move, be sure to update Your billing address, if You get a new credit/debit card, make sure You update the card number and/or expiration date) and notify YouNow if Your selected payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft).

YouNow reserves the right to suspend or terminate Your access to any Subscription-based part of the Service without notice upon rejection of any charges or if the bank or other entity that makes payment on your behalf (or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made when YouNow believes Your are liable for the charges. YouNow also reserves the right in its sole discretion to suspend or terminate Your access to any Subscription-based service if You are found, at the sole discretion of YouNow, to be in breach of the Terms of Use, or if You are suspended or banned, for any reason. That being said, You are responsible for canceling Your own Subscription(s) if You are banned from the Service.

You may choose not to renew Your Subscription-based part of the Service at any time by selecting the “Cancel Subscription” option under the Subscriptions page or by contacting support@Younow.com. Your cancellation is effective at the end of the current Subscription term.

YouNow reserves the right to change, modify or cancel the Subscription Program as it sees fit. All alterations to the Subscription Program will apply to all participants.
9. RIGHT TO SHUT DOWN, DENY OR LIMIT ACCESS, REMOVE CONTENT

YouNow has the right, but not the obligation, to screen, refuse to post, remove or edit the Content (including any Sponsored Content), at any time and for any or no reason at all, in our sole discretion. YouNow takes steps to monitor Content and keep the Site, App, and Service safe, but YouNow cannot guarantee their safety. YouNow reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to remove Content, which is abusive, illegal or disruptive, or that otherwise fails to comply with the Terms of Use, and to limit or revoke Your access in full or in part to the Service, in our sole discretion, at any time, and for any reason, including, but not limited to reasons such as technical difficulties or violation of the Terms of Use.

In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to YouNow under the Terms of Use or applicable law, YouNow expressly reserves the right to suspend, limit or terminate Your access to the Service, at any time with or without notice and with or without cause, including if YouNow determines, in YouNow's sole discretion, that You pose a threat to the Service or its users. In addition, YouNow may refer any information on illegal activities, including Your identity, to the proper authorities.

Given that the Service is provided in real-time, we would appreciate Your help in reporting to us any Content that You believe violates the Terms of Use. Please direct the relevant information, including the IP address used to commit the alleged violation and the date and time of the alleged violation, including the time zone to support.younow.com.

While we welcome any feedback or comments from You, please note that any unsolicited ideas, feedback or suggestions pertaining to our business, such as ideas for new or improved products or technologies, website or tool enhancements, processes, materials, marketing plans or new product names, will automatically upon submission become the property of YouNow, without any compensation to You. While under no obligation to review such submissions or to keep such submissions confidential, YouNow may use or redistribute any such submission and its contents for any purpose and in any way it deems fit.

To provide such submissions or feedback, please email feedback@younow.com.

If the parties are unable to agree on the mediator within five (5) business days after the Dispute is submitted to AAA, then the mediator will be selected by AAA.

Any Dispute that the parties are unable to resolve through negotiation and mediation as described above (including without limitation any dispute or controversy over the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate) will be submitted to binding and final arbitration in accordance with the following:

The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator who is expert in the field of Internet services in New York, N.Y., and administered by the AAA in accordance with its streamlined commercial arbitration rules and procedures or subsequent versions thereof, except to the extent such rules and procedures may be inconsistent with the terms of the Terms of Use. Either party may demand arbitration of a Dispute by giving the other party written notice to such effect, which notice will describe, in reasonable detail, the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the filing party’s request for relief and will include a statement of the total amount of damages claimed. In no event will You be entitled to recover punitive, special or exemplary damages or seek injunctive or any other equitable relief.

The arbitrator’s award shall be entered by either party in any court having competent jurisdiction provided that the party entering the award shall request that the court prevent the award from becoming publicly available except as may be required by law. The arbitrator shall not limit, expand or otherwise modify the terms of the Terms of Use. Each party shall bear its own expenses and pay pro rata its share of AAA fees and expenses (including, without limitation, compensation for the arbitrator). The parties agree that the existence and contents of the entire arbitration, including the award, shall be deemed a compromise of a dispute under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall not be discoverable in any proceeding, shall not be admissible in any court (except for the enforcement thereof) or arbitration and shall not bind or collaterally estop either party with respect to any claim or defense made by any third party.

The parties agree that any mediation or arbitration proceedings, testimony, or discovery, along with any documents filed or otherwise submitted in the course of any such proceedings (and including the fact that the mediation or arbitration is being conducted) shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party except to the mediators or arbitrators and their staff, the parties' attorneys and their staff, and any experts retained by the parties, or as required by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose limited information if required in any judicial proceeding brought to enforce these arbitration provisions or any award rendered hereunder.
