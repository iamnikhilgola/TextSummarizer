Hotel Booking Service
Scope of service. By making a reservation or booking through Travelzoo’s hotel booking service, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the hotel at which you book. From the point at which you make your reservation, Travelzoo acts solely as an intermediary between you and the hotel, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant hotel and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the hotel. We may charge a fee for the service we provide when you book or reserve travel services or accommodations through Travelzoo’s hotel booking service. The information disclosed on this Site regarding each hotel is based on the information provided to Travelzoo by the hotel. While Travelzoo has exercised due care in attempting to check the information provided by the hotels, Travelzoo cannot guarantee that all information is accurate, complete and correct, nor can Travelzoo or its affiliates be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our Site or otherwise), inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or untrue information (including, but not limited to, inaccuracies relating to hotel photographs, hotel property descriptions, and lists of hotel property amenities) or non-delivery of information. Each hotel remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the information shown (including the rates, availability and taxes) displayed on our Site.
Prices. Prior to booking your reservation, a total estimated price (including estimated taxes and fees) will be displayed. When you complete your booking, you authorize Travelzoo to book reservations on your behalf for the total estimated price. All charges are shown in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated. The room rate displayed on the Site is a combination of the room rate provided to Travelzoo by the hotel for the room you reserve and a fee retained by Travelzoo to compensate us for our services. Prices, rates and inventory are subject to change based on availability from the hotel and may change at any time prior to receipt of your booking confirmation. The "taxes and fees" amount displayed includes an estimate of transaction taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, excise and value added tax), government fees and other charges that the hotel must remit to the government for your hotel reservation. The type of tax charged by the hotel may change at any time and will vary by service and location. The hotel suppliers are solely responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. The hotel reserves the right to charge you additional taxes, service fees, resort fees or hotel charges (including, but not limited to, resort fees, parking charges, minibar charges, room service charges, housekeeping fees, phone call charges, movie rentals, etc.). These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the hotel at checkout. You shall be completely responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments arising out of the use of this Site and the booking of your hotel room. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether any additional taxes, service fees or charges apply. In the event a service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information, Travelzoo and/or the hotel retain the right to refuse or cancel your reservation whether or not the order has been confirmed. If available, we will offer you the opportunity to keep your pending reservation at the correct price or will cancel your reservation without penalty. Travelzoo and/or the hotel are under no obligation to provide travel services to you at an incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent confirmation of your booking.
FREE extras. We have negotiated with hotels to offer special benefits called Free extras with certain bookings based on rates and availability. Please note that Free extras are not available for all rates and bookings or other hotel deals displayed on the Site and therefore it is important that you read the booking details carefully so you understand what your booking entails and whether you are entitled to receive a Free extra. If a Free extra, or any portion thereof, cannot be provided by the hotel for any reason whatsoever, the hotel and/or Travelzoo reserve the right to substitute the perk with another perk or no perk at all if one is not available at the time of your stay. Free extras are not guaranteed. Unless otherwise noted, all extras are per room, per stay and can only be used once at the time of your scheduled booking and can no longer be used after checkout. The estimated dollar value of the extras is based on information provided to us by the hotel and may vary depending on availability and market conditions. Extras have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash or a cash value. No refund or credit will be issued for any unused extra (or portion of an extra). A complimentary breakfast Free extra is based on the total number of travelers entered at the time of the booking and the hotel may, at its option, limit this amount to a maximum of two guests per room per stay. Breakfast may be available only in select hotel restaurants and a hotel may decide that an extra is not valid for in-room dining. Room upgrades and early check-in/late check-out are based on availability and cannot be guaranteed. Any recipient of a Free extra that involves alcoholic beverages must be of the appropriate legal age in accordance with applicable law. Other restrictions may apply. Offer is subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice.
Credit Card. Hotels require credit card or debit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, Travelzoo will send your credit or debit card information directly to the hotel at which your booking is made and Travelzoo may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well. Upon check-in, guests may be required by the hotel to present a valid ID and/or credit card or, in the hotel's discretion, debit card, in their name that is consistent with the transactional details provided to Travelzoo. For certain rates or special offers, please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged by the hotel (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking. In such circumstances, you agree that your credit card or debit card may be charged for the total estimated reservation price. Please check the room details and the booking terms thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Changes or Cancellations. By making a reservation with a hotel, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that hotel, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the hotel that may apply to your reservation during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the hotel. The terms and conditions of a hotel can be obtained with the relevant hotel. The general cancellation and no-show policy of each hotel is made available on our Site on the hotel information pages, during the reservation process and in the booking confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Hotel cancellation policies vary. If you fail to check in to your hotel on the day of your reservation and do not alert the hotel, the remaining portion of your reservation may be canceled, you may be subject to hotel-imposed penalties and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the terms and conditions of the applicable hotel. Please check room rate details and booking terms thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservations. If you would like to review, change or cancel your reservation, please review the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein or call our Customer Service. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the hotel’s cancellation and no-show policy.
Disability Needs. If you have disability needs (for example only, you need a wheelchair accessible room), you must call the hotel and verify that your disability need can be met. If your disability needs cannot be accommodated by the hotel, please call Travelzoo’s Customer Service.
Special Requests. Depending on the hotel and the reservation you book, you may or may not be able to select your room type and number and type of beds. Room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel’s sole discretion. Travelzoo cannot guarantee a non-smoking room. If you have special requests (including, for example, preferences for smoking or non-smoking rooms, a specific room, particular bedding, floor location, proximity to an elevator, connecting rooms, or pet accommodations), you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be met after you have made your booking. Since Travelzoo has no control over which room a hotel will assign you, Travelzoo may not be able to accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and cannot guarantee that special requests will be met. In addition, frequent traveler points, upgrades, certificate vouchers and other discounts or incentives may not apply to Travelzoo’s hotel services.
Correspondence. By completing a booking, you agree to receive email communications which we may send you (or your guest) shortly prior to your arrival date, giving you information on your destination and providing you with certain information and offers (including any Travelzoo promotions, offers or deals) relevant to your reservation and destination. We may also send you an email promptly after your stay inviting you to complete our customer review form.
Hotel Ratings. Hotel ratings displayed on this Site are intended as only general guidelines, and Travelzoo and its affiliates do not guarantee the accuracy of the ratings or the consistency of the ratings across other online or offline platforms. Travelzoo reserves the right to change a hotel’s ratings at its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.

If you use this Site for or on behalf of a third-party ("Third-party"), such as a family member or a traveling companion, you are responsible for any error in the accuracy of information provided in connection with such use; including, but not limited to, the billing address and phone number of the credit card holder.

Best Rate Guarantee Terms
If you find a lower rate published online within 24 hours of your booking through Travelzoo and comply with all of the following terms and conditions, we will match the rate or refund the difference to you. The Best Rate Guarantee applies to the room rate only and does not include any charges for taxes, service fees or any other charges a hotel may charge (e.g., resort charges, parking). You can submit a claim by contacting Customer Service within the 24-hour deadline.

Following submission of a claim, Travelzoo Customer Service will contact you shortly thereafter via e-mail or phone. If we are unable to replicate the lower rate, we may request additional information and documentation (such as a screen shot of the lower, published online rate) from you in order to verify the lower online rate. Please keep a copy of all such documentation. The lower rate must be available for booking and visible on the other website at the time you contact us, as determined by our Customer Service team. Once we have received a complete and accurate claim form and Customer Service has verified your claim, we will notify you by email and match the rate or refund you the difference after you have completed your stay.

In order to be eligible for our Best Rate Guarantee the following conditions must be met:

You have made a hotel reservation or booking through Travelzoo’s hotel booking service and have received a booking confirmation. Your booking confirmation is required as proof of purchase. Voucher deals and purchases made on other websites based on deals featured on Travelzoo do not qualify for the Best Rate Guarantee;
You contacted us within 24 hours of making a booking, either by calling our Customer Service team during business hours or submitting the online Best Rate Guarantee form. (Claims received after this deadline will not be honored); and
You have submitted all required documents and demonstrated that the other lower rate is (i) bookable online, available to the general public, and is still available online when our Customer Service representatives check to verify the claim; and (ii) subject to the exact same itinerary and conditions as your Travelzoo booking (including among other things, the same hotel, same room and bed type with a similar view and room size, the same number of rooms and guests, same check-in and check-out dates, and the cancellation policy is the same or less restrictive than the policy associated with your Travelzoo booking).
The Best Rate Guarantee applies to rates available on the World Wide Web and does not include rates available through other reservation channels. The Best Rate Guarantee is not available for reservations on websites or applications where the name or location of the hotel or other reservation details is unknown until after you purchase or where you name your own price. The Best Rate Guarantee applies only to rates both advertised online and available to the general public. For example, the Best Rate Guarantee will not apply to negotiated rates (e.g., corporate discount rates, group rates, meeting rates or convention rates), special discounted rates to organizations or members (e.g., AARP, AAA, employee, seniors, military, government, travel agents) or other rates not available to the general public. The Best Rate Guarantee also does not apply to hotel rooms purchased through or in combination with a membership program, frequent stay, loyalty, points or other "reward" type programs or rooms purchased through coupon promotions, travel vouchers, promotion codes or won through contests or sweepstakes. The lower rate cannot be in any way connected to a packaged deal (such as rates that include a combination of a room and airfare or car rental) or involve the use of a coupon or other promotion not offered or advertised to the general public. The lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate or from an email that you received. Travelzoo may deny claims where the difference between the rates is less than one percent of the room rate. Additional restrictions may apply.

Travelzoo reserves the right to determine in its sole discretion whether a claim qualifies for the Best Rate Guarantee. Travelzoo is the final authority on interpretation of these rules and all requests are subject to verification by our Customer Service. We will not accept screenshots or other purported evidence of a lower price that we cannot independently confirm. Nor will we verify any request that we believe, in our sole discretion, is the result of a printing or any other type of error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith. We may also deny claims where we determine that the difference between the rates is due to exchange rate fluctuations. Travelzoo will not be liable for the payment of any claims under the Best Rate Guarantee with respect to rates loaded in error by Travelzoo or the hotel or from any printing, typographical, administrative or technological errors relating to rates backed by the Best Rate Guarantee.

Travelzoo has the right to deny any claims that cannot be independently verified at the time it processes the claim, or for which incomplete information has been provided. A Best Rate Guarantee reward will only be provided if the individual making the valid claim stays in the reserved hotel room. Only one refund per qualifying purchase will be allowed. Travelzoo reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify, terminate or discontinue the Best Rate Guarantee or to restrict its availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason whatsoever, and without prior notice to you. Void where prohibited by law.

FURTHER, THE HOTELS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ON THE SITE ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND NOT AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES OF THE COVERED PARTIES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COVERED PARTIES DO NOT ASSUME LIABILITY FOR ANY INJURY, DAMAGE, DEATH, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS, ACCIDENT OR DELAY DUE TO AN ACT, ERROR OR OMISSION OF A HOTEL OR SERVICE PROVIDER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AN ACT OF NEGLIGENCE OR THE DEFAULT OF A SERVICE PROVIDER, OR AN ACT OF GOD.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REFLECTS THE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. In addition, to the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of this Site within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.

Travel Destinations
You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Travelzoo shall not be liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to such destinations. Travelzoo urges passengers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States Government and the aviation administration prior to booking travel to international destinations. Information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations can be found at www.state.gov, www.tsa.gov, www.dot.gov, www.faa.gov, www.cdc.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.customs.gov.

BY OFFERING TRAVEL SERVICES TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, TRAVELZOO DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.

Arbitration and Applicable Law
To the extent permitted by law, this Agreement and the provision of our services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with New York law. By using this Site, you agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies that you may have against Travelzoo or any of the Covered Parties (defined above) arising out of or relating to or connected in any way to (i) your use of this Site (ii) any services obtained from or provided by Travelzoo or (iii) this Agreement (including the interpretation and scope of this clause and the arbitrability of the dispute), shall be resolved exclusively by mandatory, binding arbitration initiated through and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). You further agree that arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA, and that any arbitration proceeding, if necessary, will be held in New York, New York or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by Travelzoo and you. Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. In order to initiate arbitration with the AAA, you may be responsible for paying a filing fee to the AAA, however, in the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Travelzoo will reimburse as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. There will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action or representative basis. You understand and agree that, by accepting these terms and conditions, you and Travelzoo (and any Covered Party) are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action with respect to the claims covered by this mandatory arbitration provision. You are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, and not a judge or jury.

All claims you bring against Travelzoo must be resolved in accordance with this arbitration provision. All claims filed or brought by you contrary to this provision will be considered improperly filed and void. Should you file a claim contrary to this arbitration provision, Travelzoo will notify you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you must promptly withdraw the claim. If you fail to promptly withdraw the claim after receiving written notice from Travelzoo, Travelzoo may recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred to enforce this arbitration provision.

If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision was not contained herein.

Termination
Notwithstanding any of these terms and conditions, Travelzoo reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever to terminate your license to use this Site, and to block or prevent future access to and use of this Site. Travelzoo shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to this Site.

Severability
If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
