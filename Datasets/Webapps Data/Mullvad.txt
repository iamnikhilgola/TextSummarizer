Credit cards
Subscriptions may be cancelled by the subscriber at any time from the account page. No more money will be drawn from the card thereafter and service will cease when the current one month period ends.
Privacy policy
Privacy is a universal right.
We don't tell anyone anything.
We don't log our users' activities.
When Swedish law requires us to divulge information about our customers we make sure not to have that information stored, so that we have nothing to give out.
However, credit card payments and bank transfers leave records. These are kept by the banks and card companies and can't be erased by us. To pay anonymously, use cash or Bitcoin with proper anonymisation.
