 We also have developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook
 And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products
To provide these services, we must collect and use your personal data
Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes
Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission)
We can remove content you share in violation of these provisions and, if applicable, we may take action against your account, for the reasons described below
If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take action against your account to protect our community and services, including by suspending access to your account or disabling it
 We may also disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights
To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies
Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a nonexclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royaltyfree, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings)
 This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use
 In addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours)
 We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law
 We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content)
