Creating and Running a Campaign
When you, as a Campaign Owner creates a Campaign on the Site and asks for Contributions, you understand that you are entering into separate legal agreements with both Indiegogo and with Contributors, and the following rules apply (in addition to the all other Terms and Additional Policies).

Service Fees. Campaign Owners are charged a Service Fee as a portion of the Contributions they raise (the "Service Fees"). The Service Fees are effective on the date that the Service Fees are posted, and may be updated from time to time. Service Fees will be charged at the then-current rate. In connection receiving Contributions from Contributors, Campaign Owners appoint Indiegogo as the Campaign Owner's limited agent for the sole purpose of receiving, holding, and settling payments to such Campaign Owner. As a Campaign Owner's agent, Indiegogo's receipt of Contributions on a Campaign Owner's behalf is the same as receipt of Contributions by directly by a Campaign Owner.
Right to Withhold Funds. Campaign Owners should not assume that they will receive Contributions made to a Campaign. There may be a delay between the end of a Campaign and our remittance of Contributions to a Campaign Owner for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, refunds, chargeback disputes, fraud, Terms or other policy violations, or any other situation. For example, Indiegogo may hold Contributions made to a Campaign, or from any third parties holding Contributions to a Campaign, if the Campaign Owner violates any Terms (as determined by Indiegogo in its sole discretion). Indiegogo may also seek reimbursement from a Campaign Owner by any other lawful means, including by using third-party collection services.
Refunds. Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors in accordance with our Refund Policy. Refunds outside of our Refund Policy must be handled by the Campaign Owner, and Indiegogo has no obligation to provide any refunds or become involved with any dispute between a Campaign Owner and Contributor. Indiegogo reserves the right to terminate User Accounts and remove Campaigns for any abuse of the Refund Policy.
Legal obligations of Campaign Owners
As a Campaign Owner, you are entering into a legal agreement with a Contributor when they make a Contribution to your Campaign, which includes the following obligations (in addition to the all other Terms and Additional Policies):

Make good faith efforts to fulfill the Perks associated with a Campaign in the timeframe that is communicated to Contributors.
Immediately notify Contributors if there are obstacles or delays.
Respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed to them by Contributors.
Provide substantive and quality updates at least once a month to Contributors.
If you have received the Contributions from your Campaign, issue refunds to Contributors if you cannot deliver Perks.
Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the use of Contributions and delivery of Perks.
Comply with EEA Data Controller Obligations. As a Campaign Owner, you (and Indiegogo) will independently fulfill all duties required of data controllers under applicable EEA data protection law (such law shall include, but not be limited to, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”); (iii) the EU e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC), including subsequent variations, such as the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC (“ePrivacy Regulation”), if enacted).
Your data controller duties include:

Determining and qualifying the necessary legal basis or bases for your collection or processing of personal information;
Managing and reporting security incidents;
Transfers;
Entering into contracts only with data processors that provide adequate protections for personal data and including appropriate contractual language;
Maintaining records of your data processing activities;
Conducting any required data protection impact assessments; and
Implementing and maintaining all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR.
Respond to EEA Data Subject Requests. You and Indiegogo will have an independent obligation to respond to any requests received by either of us from EEA data subjects regarding personal data, including without limitation, those set forth in Chapter III of the GDPR. The party that receives the data request is responsible for responding to the request. Campaign Owner and Indiegogo shall reasonably cooperate and assist each other with these requests, to the extent that is legally permissible.
Please remember that as a Campaign Owner, you are solely responsible for fulfilling the obligations of your Campaign and delivering Perks. If you are unable to perform on this, or any of your other legal obligations, you may be subject to legal action by Contributors.

Backing a Campaign
When a Contributor makes a Contribution to a Campaign, Contributor understands that the following rules and terms apply (in addition to any other Additional Policies as mentioned in the Additional Policies section above).

Voluntary Contributions. All Contributions are made voluntarily and at the sole discretion and risk of the Contributor.
No Guarantee. The date to deliver a Perk is an estimate by the Campaign Owner (not Indiegogo) and there is no guarantee that the Campaign Owner will fulfill and deliver the Perk by that date. Indiegogo does not guarantee that Contributions will be used as promised, that Campaign Owners will deliver Perks, or that the Campaign will achieve its goals. Indiegogo also does not endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties for or about the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign, Perk or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of User Content posted on the Services.
Limited Refund. Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors only where the Campaign has not ended, the Contributor has not received a Perk (as confirmed by Indiegogo), and the Contribution has not been sent to the Campaign Owner (full terms of the Refund Policy apply). Indiegogo does not offer refunds outside of our Refund Policy. In any situation where refunds are not available under the Refund Policy, a Contributor should contact the Campaign Owner directly to request a refund. Indiegogo may at its discretion facilitate communications between a Campaign Owner and Contributor, but we have no obligation to do so or to become involved in any way in any dispute.
Credit Card Charges. When you Contribute to a Campaign, your card will be charged the amount of the Contribution after you confirm and submit your payment information.
Communications Between Campaign Owners and Contributors. Once you have made a Contribution to a Campaign, the Campaign Owners may need to contact you to obtain additional information such as shipping address, specific preferences for a Perk (i.e. color or size of a t-shirt), or may ask for your feedback on the Campaign or the Perk. In some instances, to receive the Perk, you may need to provide the requested information within the requested time frame to receive the Perk, otherwise, it will not be fulfilled. Campaign Owners should not ask for information that is not required to fulfill a Perk and should not request sensitive personal information such a Social Security number or credit card/banking information. Please contact us here if you receive a request for information that appears to be excessive.
Taxes are your responsibility. Contributors are solely responsible for determining how to treat their Contributions and receipt of any Perks for tax purposes.
Indiegogo’s Role
We do not endorse any User Content. While Indiegogo supports the creation of Campaigns, we only provide the Site for Users to interact. We do not pre-screen any Campaigns or endorse any User Content on our site.
We may remove User Content in our discretion. If you see User Content that violates these Terms, then let us know and we may remove it. Removing content or terminating accounts is not an action we take lightly and we may take a while to investigate and determine if User Content should be removed. We do not communicate our reasons for removing, or keeping, User Content on the Site.
We do not guarantee Perks or Refunds. Campaign Owners are solely responsible for the delivery of Perks and offering refunds outside of our Refund Policy.
We do not provide tax or legal advice to Users. Users are solely responsible for determining how the tax laws, or any other laws, apply to running a Campaign, Contributing to a Campaign, or utilizing any of the Services.
We do not become involved in legal disputes between Users or third parties. Though we may facilitate discussions between Users who have disputes with each other, Indiegogo takes no responsibility and does not have any liability for any disputes or violations of agreements between any Users, including between Campaign Owners and Contributors or Campaign Owners and any third parties.
You are responsible for your Campaigns, even if you engage our help. Indiegogo may offer services to Users, including without limitation, helping with drafting Campaign content, assisting with the design of Campaigns, and referring vendors and other service providers to Campaign Owners. Such services will be subject to separate agreement between Campaign Owners and Indiegogo. Even if we help with your Campaign, Campaign Owners remain solely responsible for the Campaign and must comply with all obligations herein as the only responsible party for the Campaign.
Fees and Taxes
Service Fees. There are no fees for creating an account on the Site. Campaign Owners are charged a Service Fee as a portion of the Contributions they raise. The Service Fees are effective on the date that the Service Fees are posted, and will be announced on Service Fee page.
Taxes. Taxing authorities may classify Contributions as taxable income to the Campaign Owner and any beneficiary who will receive funds directly from the applicable Campaign. Indiegogo may ask for the tax identification number (TIN) of Campaign Owners and any beneficiaries so that we may report taxable income to the relevant taxing authorities. Indiegogo will provide Campaign Owners with a tax document if required by the relevant taxing authorities. Indiegogo is unable to provide any User or third party with tax advice and suggests that such Users or third parties consult with tax advisors of their choice.

The compensation shall be due to Indiegogo whether a company’s raise is successful or not.

Indiegogo may choose to compensate outside sources to help market Indiegogo’s business and to receive introductions to possible issuers.

Waiver and Release (for CA Residents)
For Users in a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding waiver and release then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this Agreement, waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 for unknown claims which states: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." You waive this section of the California Civil Code and any similar provision in law, regulation or code that has the same effect or intent as the foregoing release.

Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration Will Be Handled In San Francisco, CA and Subject to California Law.
Indiegogo is in based in San Francisco, California, so for any actions not subject to arbitration, you and Indiegogo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco, CA or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

We encourage you to contact us if you have an issue, as most issues can be resolved without the involvement of a court or arbitrator. If negotiations do not resolve any disputes relating to your use of Indiegogo or these Terms, you and we agree to submit the dispute to arbitration. The only exceptions to arbitration are (1) for intellectual property claims alleging misuse, Infringement, or misappropriation of intellectual property; (2) for claims falling within the jurisdiction of small claims court; and (3) where you have opted out of arbitration in accordance with these Terms.

This arbitration must be administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Arbitrations may only take place on an individual basis. No class arbitrations or other grouping of parties is allowed. By agreeing to these terms you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative proceeding; we are also waiving these rights. If this prohibition of class arbitrations or other grouping of parties is deemed unenforceable, then this entire “Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” shall be deemed void and severed from the Terms. We follow the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for all arbitrations done under these terms. Among other things, this means that if you initiate an arbitration against us, you will be required to pay a $250 filing fee, and Indiegogo will pay for the other fees, including arbitrator fees. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. It also means that the arbitration will be held in the county in which you live, or any other location we agree upon. If you do not live in the United States, however, you agree to initiate arbitration in San Francisco, California. If any portion of these terms do not follow that standard, that portion is severed from these terms.

To file an arbitration, you must: (a) submit a Demand for Arbitration and $250 in filing fees to JAMS; and (b) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Indiegogo at 965 Mission St, 7th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, ATTN: Legal Department.

You can opt-out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending an email (from your registered email address on Indiegogo) letting us know that you are opting out by contacting us with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT" within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Site, or the Effective Date of the first Terms of Use containing an arbitration and class action waiver provision, whichever is later. Otherwise, you agree to arbitrate. If you opt-out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above, we will not be subject to them either with respect to any disputes with you.

Indiegogo will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by updating these Terms, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted the Site or sent to you. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this paragraph is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.

This “Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section shall survive any termination of your account, these Terms, or the Services.
